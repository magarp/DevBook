# Laravel 8.2 REST APi for DevBook
This API is created using Laravel 8.2 API Resource. It has Users. Protected routes are also added. Protected routes are accessed via Passport access token. The program will allow the user to create, update, read, and delete User model. I have also added a scheduler which will run every day to clean inactive users. If the user are inactive for 6 month, notification mail will be sent using mailtrap and deleted if they are still inactive following week. Middleware LastActive is used in order to record the inactivity of the user. 

#### Following are the Models
